					In her masterful first novel Mrs. Kimble, Jennifer Haigh delivers the riveting story of three women who marry the same man.Ken Kimble is revealed through the eyes of the women he seduces: his first wife, Birdie, who struggles to hold herself together following his desertion; his second wife, Joan, a lonely heiress shaken by personal tragedy, who sees in Kimble her last chance at happiness; and finally Dinah, a beautiful but damaged woman half his age. Woven throughout is the story of Kimble&#39;s son, Charlie, whose life is forever affected by the father he barely remembers. Kimble is a chameleon, a man able to become, at...

				<h3>More About <span>Mrs. Kimble</span></h3>
				<p>His words stayed with her for years. Each night as she lay waiting for sleep, she tried to re-create the evening in her mind the tone of his voice, his hand on her shoulder. Soon the memory was worn as an old photograph, the edges fuzzy from frequent handling; she worried that shed gotten the words wrong, forgotten some nuance of his face or voice. Finally she wondered if shed made the whole thing up. Jennifer Haigh, Mrs. Kimble // When they touched it was like touching her own body. From childhood they had been the same height; their arms and legs and hands were still perfectly congruent. Only the centers of them were different, aching, fascinated, every part of them heated to the same temperature as the sun warmed pond. Jennifer Haigh, Mrs. Kimble // Destiny, shed learned, was written in the heavens; a person couldnt take what the universe didnt wish to give. Jennifer Haigh, Mrs. Kimble //</p>
				<p>Well-written story, no question, but terribly sad. I couldn&#39;t give it more than three stars for its depressing effect.Don&#39;t get me wrong. No gory, tragic deaths (well, maybe one semi-tragic one but kind of expected), no major child abuse (just some neglect), just some sad, sad stories of three women who fall for the same rotten remorseless... I&#39;m a big fan of Jennifer Haigh&#39;s writing -- and I worked my way backward through all of it. Finishing this debut novel means I have to wait for her next book to be published. I&#39;ll try to be patient.There is a common thread in her novels, of family dysfunction and neglect, and the psychic cost to children of this neglect. The story... Psychological Profiles</p>
