					 A Horror, Classics, Mystery book. The trees around and overhead were so thick that it was always dry...

				<p class="description">
					Merricat Blackwood lives on the family estate with her sister Constance and her Uncle Julian. Not long ago there were seven Blackwoods—until a fatal dose of arsenic found its way into the sugar bowl one terrible night. Acquitted of the murders, Constance has returned home, where Merricat protects her from the curiosity and hostility of the villagers. Their days pass in happy isolation until cousin Charles appears. Only Merricat can see the danger, and she must act swiftly to keep Constance from his grasp.

				<h3>More About <span>We Have Always Lived in the Castle</span></h3>
				<p>When Jim Donell thought of something to say he said it as often and in as many ways as possible, perhaps because he had very few ideas and had to wring each one dry. Shirley Jackson, We Have Always Lived in the Castle // I was pretending that I did not speak their language; on the moon we spoke a soft, liquid tongue, and sang in the starlight, looking down on the dead dried world. Shirley Jackson, We Have Always Lived in the Castle // The trees around and overhead were so thick that it was always dry inside and on Sunday morning I lay there with Jonas, listening to his stories. All cat stories start with the statement: &#34;My mother, who was the first cat, told me this,&#34; and I lay with my head close to Jonas and listened. There was no change coming, I thought here, only spring; I was wrong to be so frightened. The days would get warmer, and Uncle Julian would sit in the sun, and Constance would laugh when she worked in the garden, and it would always be the same. Jonas went on and on...</p>
				<p>In The Haunting of Hill House, Shirley Jackson&#39;s group of misguided investigators discuss the idea that some houses are inherently born evil, and are destined to be haunted from the moment they&#39;re built. We Have Always Lived in the Castle explores the opposite idea: how a home becomes a haunted house.One of the many, many fascinating... Shirley Jackson&#39;s last novel (written three years before her untimely death at the age of forty-eight) is not what I expected. Yet, I loved it. Still I can see why many readers were left scratching their heads. Isn&#39;t Jackson supposed to write scary stories? But....wow....This is certainly unsettling. And there really ARE a lot of similarities... This is my favorite book of all time, hands down, case closed. Shirley Jackson wrote the short story &#34;The Lottery,&#34; which is about a creepy small town. This follows in that tradition. It&#39;s about the Blackwells-- Mary Katherine, who is 18 but reads 12 to me, Constance, who is an adult but reads 18, and frail old Uncle Julian. And Jonas...</p>
