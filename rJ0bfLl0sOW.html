				</p>
				<p class="description">
					The Red River Pack is trouble. They&#39;ve always been trouble, but they&#39;ve been accumulating wealth and not through the official channels. So when they send outcast, Allie Morgan, to the Council, the daughter of a half-breed wolf and his human mate, they seize the opportunity they&#39;ve been presented and put her to work for Lucas Kildare, the wolf in charge of the finances for all packs. Unfortunately, there&#39;s one thing they didn&#39;t count on... Allie is Lucas&#39; destined mate and from the moment they set eyes on one another, sparks fly. Lucas can&#39;t keep his hands, his mouth and every other part of his anatomy off Allie. But he still has a job to do, and that means getting to the bottom of whatever illegal business the Red River Pack has gotten themselves into, including Allie&#39;s father. Will she be able to forgive him or will his job cost him everything he desires? Working for the Wolf is an 11,000 word novella featuring modern day werewolves, a BBW heroine, and lots of hot and steamy love scenes only appropriate for mature readers....

				<h3>More About <span>Working For The Wolf</span></h3>
				<p></p>
				<p>Working for the Wolf! Just as you get totally into the story it ends. Now its the waiting game for the next part.Yes, I enjoyed this story. So many questions. Can&#39;t wait until I know what happens next. Very good!This is a great start to this installment series. I can&#39;t wait to see what happens next. The only thing that I didn&#39;t like is that there isn&#39;t a clear description of the characters. Since this is a BBW story, I was looking for more. The only thing that I caught was that the heroine had curves. That&#39;s all it says. Other than... So, I did like it but it is a series it seems. This was released in January of 2015 and we haven&#39;t gotten anything else from the series. I am anxious to get more of the story. I am pretty sure there are going to be repercussions for Lucas because he&#39;s keeping things from her. He marker her without asking or even talking about it. She&#39;s...</p>
