					 A Autobiography, Memoir, Nonfiction book. Honestly, the world can be a dark enough place. Light it up....
				</p>
				<p class="description">
					From his Glaswegian childhood and American adolescence to his starring role in the Doctor Who spinoff Torchwood, this memoir traces the life and career of actor John Barrowman. John made a name for himself with remarkable West End achievements, including an Olivier Award nomination and success in the movies The Producers and De-Lovely. Television success was also assured when Torchwood won a Best Drama BAFTA. John also lays bare his personal life: his emigration as a child, coming out to his family, turning down a job at Disney, and his civil partnership with long-term partner Scott Gill. Revelatory and insightful, told with real heart and characteristic Barrowman charm, this is a wonderful tale of how one boy achieved his dreams. (taken from Amazon.com)

				<h3>More About <span>Anything Goes</span></h3>
				<p>Cut! Go again.&#34;And again, and again, and again. Finally, after the fourth of fifth take I yelled down the hill to the director: &#34;This isn&#39;t a fucking marathon! If we&#39;re going to go again, tell him on the bloody bike to slow down.&#34;David turned to me and said, &#34;Having a bit of trouble, Captain?&#34;&#34;That&#39;s all right for you to say,&#34; I laughed breathlessly, &#34;but I&#39;m carrying a rucksack on my back with your fucking hand in a glass jar inside John Barrowman, Anything Goes // Many things shaped my identity as a young boy: a strong selfworth (something that was instilled in all three Barrowman siblings by our parents), my immersion in theatre and music, and my DNA. I was born gay. It&#39;s not a choice I or anyone else who is gay made. If it were, why on earth would anyone choose to be part of a minority, part of a group that in so many cultures and countries, even in the twenty-first century, is regularly blasphemed, hounded and worse? John Barrowman, Anything Goes // Honestly, the world can be a dark enough place. Light it up. John Barrowman, Anything Goes //</p>
				<p>While I loved John Barrowman&#39;s character Captain Jack, I thought his memoir was an over the top opportunity for John to name drop and talk about his love of himself, wonderful voice and good looks. It was quirky and entertaining at times, but over all long and boring. I thoroughly enjoy John Barrowman&#39;s performance as the dashing and handsome Captain Jack Harkness of Doctor Who and Torchwood so when I stumbled across this memoir I thought, what the hell. I have no obsessive love of Barrowman but he seems to have an engaging personality. So....This book was written collaboratively with Carole Barrowman,... Lots of grins &amp; laughs in this book. I have a deep love for Glasgow, so the description of the early part of his life in that city and the Glaswegian expressions that persist through the rest of the book were probably my favorite things. I&#39;m also fond of the musical Anything Goes, so the fact that John has been in it so many times is...</p>
